# Description

In this assignment, I created a new React Native project using the Expo CLI. In the App.js file, I made the following changes:

1. I changed the background color of the View component to a shade of sea blue(#008080).

2. I edited the Text component to display the text "My name is Anuonyam Amo-Mensah".

3. I increased the font size of the text to 24.

4. Made the name "Anuonyam Amo-Mensah" bold.
